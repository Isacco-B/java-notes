# Java Notes - Personal Notes Application

Java Notes is a cross-platform application that enables users to securely create, manage, and organize their personal notes. The project consists of two main components: a client-side desktop application built with JavaFX and a server-side RESTful API that handles the logic and database management.

The client provides an intuitive user interface (UI) with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing notes, while the server implements JWT-based authentication and advanced security features to ensure user data privacy and integrity
